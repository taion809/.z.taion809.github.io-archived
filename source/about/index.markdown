### Who am I?
Software developer with 5 years network and system administration experience serving the armed forces as a US Navy Information Systems Technician, and 2 years abroad as a software engineer for Global Agent then for an American firm ClearlyM.  Much more recently I have begun work for an American company in New York City.

If this sounds a little too 'resume', that is because it is copy-pasta.. sorry I'm not very creative.
